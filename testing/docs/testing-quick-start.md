title: Testing Quick Start
---

The testing rig in `quasar-cli` is a mode that you have to explicitly add to your quasar project, which you can (should) enable during the init phase, or later at any point.

#### Available commands:
```bash 
$ quasar mode --add test

$ quasar new --test "Popup.vue"

$ quasar test -u        # runs mocha-webpack --watch 
$ quasar test -c        # runs code-coverage with NYC
$ quasar test -e        # runs e2e with Cypress
$ quasar test -l        # runs code quality with Lighthouse cli
$ quasar test -q        # runs code quality with lighthouse node (advanced)
§ quasar test -a        # runs all tests (WIP)

$ quasar dev -m test    # runs dev server with mocha-webpack --watch
``` 

#### WARNING

> Adding the test mode will overwrite the folder in your project root that is named `test` - if you have one!!! Furthermore, removing the mode with `quasar mode --remove test` will **irretrievably delete** this folder and all of your specs and reports!

## Directory Structure

Here are the files and folders that will be generated within your project root:

```

```

Within the test folder are some initialization scripts as well as a sample testing specification that we have built for you to test one quasar component that is provided. Furthermore, adding the `test` mode also creates several dotfiles in your root folder for the configuration of the testing. You may edit these, but if you do so, please remember to delete the json files in the autogenerated .nyc_output folder.

## What you get

This mode ships with a **spec** that verifies:
- that vue builds correctly in your environment
- that a quasar component (q-btn) works as expected
- that there is 100% coverage of the component
- that the e2e test does not fail (using cypress)
- that your app/site has some quality according to Lighthouse

#### TIP!
> On some setups we have noticed that **nyc** will not reinitialise itself unless you remove its output files from the output folder - which can be rather disconcerting when changes have been made to your coverage settings. Make sure you have the latest **yarn** or **npm**.
