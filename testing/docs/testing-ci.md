title: CI and Tests
---

Continuous Integretation testing is more of an approach to application development. It is often scheduled to run on a pull-request, which makes sure that the code that has been changed "still" passes all of the tests that have been set up.

It can also be used as a sanity-check during build processes, but that is an advanced topic.

You can use any of the test-runners in Quasar to help you to get you build-pipeline manage CI tasks.
